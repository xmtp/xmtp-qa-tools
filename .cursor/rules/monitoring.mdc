# Monitoring system

We've built a monitoring setup that tells us when things are working well and alerts us immediately when they're not.

## Automated workflows

Our test suite is organized into 6 primary categories that validate XMTP protocol functionality, performance, and reliability across different scales and environments.

## 1. Performance testing
