# README Style Guide

## README Writing Standards

When creating or editing README files, follow these strict guidelines:

### Content Style

- **No emojis**: Never use emojis in READMEs
- **Concise**: Be brief and to the point
- **No redundancy**: Avoid repeating information
- **Code-heavy**: Prioritize code examples and snippets over lengthy explanations

### Structure

- Use clear, direct headers without decorative elements
- Lead with practical examples rather than theory
- Include minimal explanatory text - let code speak for itself
- Focus on "how" rather than "why"

### Format Requirements

- Use plain text headers (no emoji prefixes)
- Include more code blocks than paragraphs
- Keep descriptions brief - one sentence when possible
- Use tables for structured data without emoji indicators

### Code Examples

- Always include working code examples
- Show real command line usage
- Provide copy-paste ready snippets
- Include minimal setup instructions

### Performance Tables

- Use text instead of emoji status indicators:
  - "On Target" instead of ✅
  - "Concern" instead of ⚠️
  - "Failed" instead of ❌
- Keep table data clean and readable

### Anti-patterns to Avoid

- Emoji decorations in headers or content
- Long explanatory paragraphs
- Redundant information across sections
- Flowery or marketing language
- Over-explanation of simple concepts
