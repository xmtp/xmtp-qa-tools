Please analyze the following directories in my project:
- /bots
- /scripts
- /functional
- /helpers
- /suites
- /.github/workflows

For each directory, create or update the README.md file with a comprehensive overview that follows this pattern:

1. Start with a clear title using an emoji that represents the directory's purpose
2. Provide a concise introduction explaining the directory's purpose
3. Include a "Quick reference" table with columns for files/modules, purpose, and key features
4. Add a "Usage" section with code examples when applicable
5. Create detailed sections for each major file/component with:
   - Code snippets demonstrating usage
   - Key features in bullet points
   - Configuration options if applicable
6. Add sections for configuration, best practices, and monitoring where relevant

Make the README.md content similar in style and format to this example:

```markdown
# Agent Health Testing Suite

This test suite validates the health and responsiveness of live XMTP agents in production environments.

## What it does (units)

- Create DM conversation with agent using their Ethereum address
- Send configured test message to agent
- Verify agent responds within expected timeframe
- Validate message delivery and response patterns

## Environment Setup

Set `XMTP_ENV` to either `dev` or `production` to test agents on the corresponding network.

## How to run

### Run all agent tests

```bash
yarn test agents
```

## Configuration

The `production.json` file contains agent configurations with these fields:

- `name` - Agent identifier
- `address` - Ethereum address of the agent
- `sendMessage` - Test message to send to the agent
- `networks` - Array of networks the agent supports (`["dev", "production"]`)
- `disabled` - Optional flag to skip testing this agent
- `expectedMessage` - Optional array of expected response keywords

## Key files

- **[production.json](mdc:production.json)** - Configuration file containing agents to test with their addresses, test messages, and supported networks
- **[agents.test.ts](mdc:agents.test.ts)** - Main test implementation
- **[GitHub Actions Workflow](mdc:https:/github.com/xmtp/xmtp-qa-tools/actions/workflows/Agents.yml)** - Automated test execution configuration
```

Process each directory thoroughly, analyzing all subdirectories and files to create accurate and helpful documentation. Do not ask for clarification - use your best judgment based on file contents, directory structure, and filename patterns. Be creative in generating useful examples where direct code is not available. Deliver all README updates in a single response.
