D14N TESTNET-DEV ISSUE SUMMARY
==============================
Date: 2026-01-05
Environment: testnet-dev
  - API URL: https://grpc.testnet-dev.xmtp.network:443
  - Gateway URL: https://payer.testnet-dev.xmtp.network:443

CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS
==========================
- Gateway (payer) URL is REQUIRED - direct node access returns 404
- Must set both apiUrl and gatewayHost in client options
- No 'env' setting when using D14N (apiUrl/gatewayHost override it)

WHAT WORKS ✅
=============
1. Client.create() - Successfully creates clients with inbox IDs
2. conversations.sync() - Basic sync works
3. conversations.syncAll() - Full sync works  
4. conversations.list() - Listing works
5. preferences.inboxStateFromInboxIds() - Looking up OTHER users' inbox state works

WHAT FAILS ❌
=============
1. preferences.inboxState() (self)
   Error: "Association error: Missing identity update"
   - Can't query own inbox state
   - WORKAROUND: Skip this call on D14N

2. getKeyPackageStatusesForInstallationIds()
   Error: "mismatched number of results, key packages 0 != installation_keys N"
   - Key package lookup returns 0 results for other users
   - Sometimes works for self, sometimes doesn't (flaky)

3. conversations.newDm(inboxId)
   Error: "mismatched number of results, key packages 0 != installation_keys 1"
   - Can't create DMs because key package lookup fails
   - The DM object may be created locally but recipient never receives it

4. conversations.newGroup(inboxIds)
   Error: "mismatched number of results, key packages N != installation_keys M"
   - Same issue as DM - key package lookup fails

5. Sending messages after creation
   Error: "Content type is required when sending encoded content"
   - Conversation is in invalid state because creation partially failed

ROOT CAUSE
==========
The D14N gateway/payer has INTERMITTENT key package retrieval issues.

INTERMITTENT TEST RESULTS (5 iterations):
- Self Key Package:    60% success (3/5)
- Other Key Package:   40% success (2/5)  
- Self Inbox State:    0% success (0/5) - ALWAYS FAILS
- Other Inbox State:   0% success (0/5) - ALWAYS FAILS

When a client is created:
1. Client registers identity ✅
2. Client uploads key package ✅ (sometimes retrievable)

When creating conversation:
1. SDK queries for recipient's key packages
2. Gateway SOMETIMES returns 0 results (race condition?)
3. SDK throws mismatch error when key packages not found

EVIDENCE
========
- Key packages ARE being stored (60% self-retrieval success)
- Key packages ARE sometimes retrievable for other users (40% success)
- This suggests replication lag, caching issue, or race condition
- inboxState() is completely broken (separate bug - "Missing identity update")

NEXT STEPS FOR SERVER TEAM
==========================
1. Verify key packages are being stored when clients register
2. Check key package query endpoint returns correct data
3. Compare behavior with V3 dev network (grpc.dev.xmtp.network)

TEST COMMANDS
=============
# This will fail with key package errors:
XMTP_D14N=true XMTP_API_URL=https://grpc.testnet-dev.xmtp.network:443 yarn test delivery

# To debug manually:
XMTP_D14N=true XMTP_API_URL=https://grpc.testnet-dev.xmtp.network:443 npx tsx debug-d14n.ts
