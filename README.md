# 🚀 XMTP QA Testing Suite

This monorepo contains a comprehensive collection of tools for testing and monitoring the XMTP protocol and its implementations.

## 🧪 Test Suites

Run tests for specific modules using these commands:

- **TS_Performance**: Measures operations in milliseconds and aggregates results in a Datadog dashboard

  ```bash
  yarn test ts_performance
  ```

  [View test source](./tests/TS_Performance.test.ts)

- **TS_Delivery**: Tests multiple concurrent streams to detect any message losses

  ```bash
  yarn test ts_delivery
  ```

  [View test source](./tests/TS_Delivery.test.ts)

- **TS_Gm**: End-to-end testing for the Gm bot across browser and Node.js environments

  ```bash
  yarn test ts_gm
  ```

  [View test source](./tests/TS_Gm.test.ts)

## 👥 Workers

Predefined personas (Bob, Joe, Sam, etc.) are initialized with the `getWorkers` function:

```tsx
let personas: Record<string, Persona>;

beforeAll(async () => {
  personas = await getWorkers(["alice", "bob", "randomguy"], testName);
});

// Use them directly in your tests
convo = await personas.alice.client!.conversations.newDm(
  personas.randomguy.client!.accountAddress,
);
```

### Key Considerations:

- If a persona doesn't exist, its keys are automatically created
- Existing personas use keys from the env file and .data folder
- Missing data folders are created automatically
- Personas with the "random" prefix have keys stored only in memory

## 🤖 Test Bot

A versatile bot for manual interaction testing:

```bash
yarn bot
```
