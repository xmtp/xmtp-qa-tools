## 💬 Available Commands

| Command            | Description                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/stress [number]` | Start a stress test with the specified number of workers |
| `/stress reset`    | Terminate all workers and start over                     |

## ⚙️ Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file with the following configuration:

```bash
LOGGING_LEVEL="off"      # Options: off, error, warn, info, debug, trace
XMTP_ENV="dev"           # Options: dev, production
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-..."  # OpenAI API key
```

## 🧪 Worker Behavior

- New workers have their keys automatically created
- Existing workers use their stored keys from the env file and .data folder
- If the data folder doesn't exist, one is created automatically
- Workers prefixed with "random" have keys that are stored only in memory
