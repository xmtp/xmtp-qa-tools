## ⚙️ Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file with the following configuration:

```bash
LOGGING_LEVEL="off" # off, error, warn, info, debug, trace
XMTP_ENV="dev" # dev, production
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-..." # OpenAI API key
```

## 🧪 Considerations

- If a persona does not exist, its keys are created.
- If persona exists uses the existing env file keys and .data folder
- If the data folder doesnt exist, it creates one
- Personas prefixed with "random" have keys that are stored only in memory.

## Workers
