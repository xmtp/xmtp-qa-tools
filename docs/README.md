## Documentation Overview

This documentation covers the comprehensive testing and monitoring infrastructure for the XMTP protocol, including:

### Testing Framework
- **8 Automated Test Suites** running continuously across multiple environments
- **Cross-Platform Validation** for Browser, Node, React Native, Swift, and Kotlin SDKs
- **Scale Testing** up to 400-member groups with performance benchmarking
- **Browser Automation** using Playwright for real-world web testing
- **Agent Health Monitoring** for deployed bots and automation services

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Real-Time Metrics** collected via Datadog with custom dashboards
- **Slack Integration** for automated alerting and team notifications
- **SLO Tracking** with 99.9% delivery rate targets and error budget management
- **Multi-Region Performance** monitoring across US, EU, and Asia-Pacific regions

### Infrastructure & Automation
- **GitHub Actions Workflows** with staggered execution to prevent resource contention
- **Railway Deployments** for bot hosting and service management
- **Multi-Environment Testing** across `dev`, `production`, and local environments
- **Automated Benchmarking** with performance regression detection

## Getting Started

### For New Team Members
1. Start with [Test Suites](./test-suites.md) to understand our testing approach
2. Review [Monitoring System](./monitoring.md) for observability concepts
3. Explore [Dashboards](./dashboards.md) to learn about our metrics visualization
4. Check [Workflows](./workflows.md) for CI/CD automation details

### For Contributors
1. Understand our [SLOs and SLIs](./slos-slis.md) for performance standards
2. Review [Scaling Limitations](./scaling-limitations.md) for current constraints
3. Check [Future Enhancements](./future-enhancements.md) for planned improvements
4. Follow workflow guidelines in [Workflows](./workflows.md)

### For Operators
1. Master the [Monitoring System](./monitoring.md) for daily operations
2. Use [Dashboards](./dashboards.md) for real-time system health
3. Reference [SLOs and SLIs](./slos-slis.md) for incident response
4. Check [Scaling Limitations](./scaling-limitations.md) for capacity planning

## Key Metrics & Targets

### Core SLOs
| Metric | Target | Environment |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Message Delivery Rate** | 99.9% | Production |
| **Message Latency (P95)** | <3 seconds | Production |
| **Service Availability** | 99.95% | Production |
| **Cross-Platform Compatibility** | 99.5% | All environments |
| **Large Group Performance** | 95% delivery for 400 members | All environments |

### Test Suite Coverage
- **Functional Tests**: Core protocol validation every 3 hours
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking every 30 minutes  
- **Delivery Tests**: Cross-environment reliability every 30 minutes
- **Browser Tests**: Web environment validation every 30 minutes
- **Agent Tests**: Bot health monitoring every 15 minutes
- **Large Group Tests**: Scale testing every 2 hours

## Architecture Overview

The XMTP QA Tools testing framework validates the entire XMTP protocol stack:

```
üì± Applications (xmtp.chat, Convos, Agents)
    ‚ÜïÔ∏è
üîß SDKs (Browser WASM, Node Napi, React Native, Swift FFI, Kotlin FFI)
    ‚ÜïÔ∏è
‚ö° LibXMTP (Rust core with openmls and diesel)
    ‚ÜïÔ∏è
üåê Decentralized Nodes (XMTP Network)
```

Our testing ensures:
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility** between all SDK bindings
- **Protocol Reliability** across different environments
- **Performance Standards** for enterprise-scale usage
- **Real-World Validation** through browser and mobile testing
