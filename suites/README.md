# XMTP Test Suite Engineering Report

## Test Suite Architecture

Our test suite is organized into 5 primary categories that validate XMTP protocol functionality, performance, and reliability across different scales and environments.

---

## 1. Browser Testing (`browser.test.ts`)

**Purpose**: Validates XMTP functionality in browser environments using Playwright automation.

### Test Coverage:

- `conversation stream with message` - Real-time conversation detection with content
- `conversation stream without message` - Conversation detection without messages
- `newDm and message stream` - Browser DM creation and messaging flow
- `newGroup and message stream` - Browser group creation and messaging
- `conversation stream when creating the group` - Stream notifications during group creation
- `conversation stream for new member` - Member addition stream detection
- `new installation and message stream` - Multi-installation browser validation

---

## 2. Functional + Regression Testing

**Purpose**: Core protocol validation including backward compatibility and edge case handling.

### Client Management (`clients.test.ts`)

- `validation and key package status` - Key package validation
- `inbox state from external inbox IDs` - External inbox queries
- `downgrade last versions` - Backward compatibility across SDK versions
- `upgrade last versions` - Forward compatibility testing
- `shared identity and separate storage` - Multi-installation identity management

### Content Handling (`codec.test.ts`)

- `errors: handle codec errors gracefully when sending unsupported content types` - Codec error resilience

### Debug Operations (`debug.test.ts`)

- `debug: retrieve group debug information` - Debug info structure validation
- `debug: track epoch changes during group operations` - Epoch tracking
- `debug: verify epoch consistency across members` - Cross-member synchronization
- `debug: detect potential forks in group state` - Fork detection
- `debug: verify debug info after metadata changes` - Metadata change tracking
- `debug: verify debug info structure completeness` - Complete debug validation

### Installation Management (`installations.test.ts`)

- `shared identity and separate storage` - Cross-device identity with isolated storage

### Metadata Operations (`metadata.test.ts`)

- `metadata: update group name and verify persistence` - Name updates
- `metadata: update group description and verify persistence` - Description updates
- `metadata: update group image URL` - Image URL management
- `metadata: verify metadata propagation to other members` - Cross-member propagation
- `metadata: handle empty and special characters in metadata` - Edge case handling
- `metadata: verify metadata state after group operations` - State persistence

### Permission System (`permissions.test.ts`)

- `permissions: add and remove admin permissions` - Admin role management
- `permissions: add and remove super admin permissions` - Super admin management
- `permissions: verify admin list management` - Admin list operations
- `permissions: admin can remove other members` - Admin privilege validation
- `permissions: super admin can manage other admins` - Super admin privileges

### Stream Validation (`streams.test.ts`)

- `membership: verify member addition notifications` - Member addition streams
- `consent: verify consent state changes for direct messages` - DM consent streams
- `consent: verify consent state changes in groups` - Group consent streams
- `messages: verify direct message delivery` - DM message streams
- `messages: verify group message delivery` - Group message streams
- `metadata: verify group metadata updates` - Metadata streams
- `conversations: verify new conversation notifications` - Conversation streams
- `members: verify member addition to existing group` - Member addition streams

### Synchronization (`sync.test.ts`)

- `group sync performance: should establish test environment by creating group with all participants` - Environment setup
- `group sync performance: should send baseline message to group for synchronization performance testing` - Baseline establishment
- `group sync performance: should measure performance impact of client-level conversations.sync() operation` - Client-level sync
- `group sync performance: should measure performance impact of individual conversation.sync() operation` - Individual sync
- `group sync performance: should measure message retrieval performance without explicit synchronization` - No-sync retrieval

---

## 3. Delivery, Order & Recovery Testing (`delivery.test.ts`)

**Purpose**: Validates message delivery reliability, ordering accuracy, and recovery mechanisms.

### Core Tests:

- `stream: should verify message delivery and order accuracy using streams` - Stream-based delivery validation
- `poll: should verify message delivery and order accuracy using polling` - Poll-based delivery validation
- `recovery: should verify message recovery after stream interruption` - Offline recovery testing

**Metrics Validated**:

- Reception percentage (successful message delivery)
- Order percentage (correct message sequencing)
- Recovery capability after network interruption

---

## 4. Performance Testing (`performance.test.ts`)

**Purpose**: Measures operation timing and throughput for standard group sizes (5-10 participants).

### Individual Operations:

- `create: should measure creating a client` - Client creation timing
- `canMessage: should measure canMessage` - Message capability checks
- `inboxState: should measure inboxState` - Inbox state retrieval
- `newDm: should measure creating a DM` - DM creation performance
- `send: should measure sending a gm` - Message sending timing
- `stream: should measure receiving a gm` - Message reception timing
- `newDmByAddress: should measure creating a DM` - Address-based DM creation

### Scaled Operations (per group size):

- `newGroup-{i}: should create a large group of {i} participants` - Group creation scaling
- `newGroupByAddress-{i}: should create a large group of {i} participants` - Address-based group creation
- `groupsync-{i}: should sync a large group of {i} participants` - Group sync performance
- `updateName-{i}: should update the group name` - Metadata update timing
- `send-{i}: should measure sending a gm in a group of {i} participants` - Group messaging
- `stream-{i}: should verify group message` - Group message streaming
- `addMember-{i}: should add members to a group` - Member addition performance
- `removeMembers-{i}: should remove a participant from a group` - Member removal performance

---

## 5. Large Group Testing (`large.test.ts`)

**Purpose**: Validates scalability and performance at scale (10-50+ participants).

### Scalability Tests (per group size):

- `newGroup-{groupSize}: should create a large group of {groupSize} participants` - Large group creation
- `groupsync-{groupSize}: should sync a large group of {groupSize} participants` - Large group sync
- `addMember-{groupSize}: should notify all members of additions in {groupSize} member group` - Large group notifications
- `stream-{groupSize}: should notify all members of message changes in {groupSize} member group` - Large group messaging
- `updateName-{groupSize}: should notify all members of metadata changes in {groupSize} member group` - Large group metadata
- `sync-{groupSize}: should perform cold start sync operations on {groupSize} member group` - Cold start sync
- `syncAll-{groupSize}: should perform cold start sync operations on {groupSize} member group` - Cold start syncAll

**Key Measurements**:

- Stream notification latency across large participant counts
- Synchronization performance with high member counts
- Cold start performance for new clients joining large groups
